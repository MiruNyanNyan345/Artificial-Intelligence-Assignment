# Artificial Intelligence Concept
## COMP5511 Assignment

## Challenges
This assignment consists of three quesitons about the traditional machine learning and artifical intelligence model and algorithm, however, the requirements of these three question have indicated that the student cannot implement the model and algorithm by any external library (e.g., NumPy and Pandas). It is the most challenging task in this assignment. Especially in the question 2, it requires the student to implement a bayesian classifier to classify the text data. Apart from the prediction, the most difficult part is to optimize the model without the help from the strong library (e.g, nltk). 

## Question 1

1. open terminal and go to this file
2. type "python3.7 Q1.py"

## Question 2

🌝 Training Data Accuracy: 96.35955616506669 <br>
🌚 Validation Data Accuracy: 75.88961510530137 <br><br>
⬇️ Suggested Training Parameter ⬇️<br>
🌞 Best Alpha: 0.001 <br>
🌞 Best Top N TF-IDF features: 9000 <br>

### How to run it?

1. open terminal and go to this file
2. type "python3.7 Q2.py"
3. "Please input the path of testing dataset: " << Type "Assignment Data/Q2/Test.tsv"
4. "Please input the training alpha for smoothing: " << Type the parameter value of alpha
5. "Pick top N words for training: " << Type the top N word you want to select from TF-IDF
6. When the prediction succeeded, there will be an output result file called "prediction.tsv" in the same location as
   the program file

🌟 Type "ctrl + c" to stop the program

## Question 3

1. Using jupyter notebook to open it
2. Run the whole program from top to bottom
